# ⚙️🗂️Simple PLM
A small Product Lifetime Manager I made for fun using Javascript. I made this project to train myself to use local storage and manipulate JSON datas / converting them from string to useable datas in Javascript. This app's interface has been made using ai since I barely had any time to work on it for the moment, but I'll surely add and handmade interface later on.

## Technologies
- `Javascript`
- `CSS`

## Features
Here's what you can do with Simple PLM :
- **Create a piece** : You can create a new piece you recently developed and add it to your pieces list.
- **Create versions** : You can add new versions with descriptions to your existing pieces and trace their date of creation.
- **List your pieces** : You are able to see all your existing pieces on the app's home page.

## 🧠What I learned
During the really short developement of this project, I learned what is a product lifetime manager and what are the basic expectations regarding this kind of app. On the technical side, I also learned in more deepness how Local Storage works, how to stock JSON datas using it and how to exploit these datas in my Javascript before sending it back to storage in string format.

## 💭How it could be improved?
- Add the possibility to delete pieces and versions
- Use a database using SQL instead of local storage
- Add an handmade style sheet instead of the temporary ai generated one
